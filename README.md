Description: Smart glasses that alert the user with a buzzing sound if the userâ€™s eyes are closed for more than 3 seconds.         We aim to prevent drowsy driving and help in alerting the user, ensuring safety and preventing accidents.         We have developed a functional model which runs on Embedded C programming and is highly accurate.
